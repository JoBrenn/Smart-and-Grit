## Experiments

### Simulated annealing
The file simulatedannealing_experiment contains multiple functions.\
Where in the function simulannealing_temp_comparison different temperatures are compared.
This comparison can then be visualized via either the function simulannealing_temp_comparison_mean_graph() or 
simulannealing_temp_comparison_lowest_graph. Where the mean cost and the lowest cost are compared respectively.
